# Simulation Exercise (Node-RED-Firebase-JS)

- Simulate a live time series voltage & temperature data stream from [Node-RED](https://nodered.org).
- Push the said data stream from Node-RED to [Google Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) using any HTTP client in Node-RED.
- The data stored in Firebase needs to have the following structure:

  - **Voltage**:

    The `key` for the stored json data should be the epoch at which the data was generated and the voltage
    `value` generated at that time.

    ```ts
    interface Voltage {
      [timestamp: string]: number;
    }
    ```

    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "1663306125368": 35,
      "1663306125390": 32
    }
    ```

  - **Temperature**:

    The `key` for the stored json data should be the epoch at which the data was generated and the temperature
    `value` generated at that time.

    ```ts
    interface Temperature {
      [timestamp: string]: number;
    }
    ```

    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "1663306125368": 27,
      "1663306125390": 21
    }
    ```

- Once the data starts coming into Firebase, keep fetching it in your app and plot following live charts:
  1. Realtime data of voltage and temperature in one graph.
  2. Average data per 3 minutes of voltage.
  3. Average data per 3 minutes of Temperature.
