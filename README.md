## Issues

- onChildAdded from firebase realtime database is running constantly to
  check for updates in the database, All the code execution was inside
  that listener, this oversight is causing the FE to crash due to memory
  overload, this commit switches to onValue function which is responding
  in a stable manner.

# Exercise

- Simulate a live time series voltage & temperature data stream from [Node-RED](https://nodered.org).
- Push the said data stream from Node-RED to [Google Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) using any HTTP client in Node-RED.
- The data stored in Firebase needs to have the following structure:

  - **Voltage**:

    The `key` for the stored json data should be the epoch at which the data was generated and the voltage
    `value` generated at that time.

    ```ts
    interface Voltage {
      [timestamp: string]: number;
    }
    ```

    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "1663306125368": 35,
      "1663306125390": 32
    }
    ```

  - **Temperature**:

    The `key` for the stored json data should be the epoch at which the data was generated and the temperature
    `value` generated at that time.

    ```ts
    interface Temperature {
      [timestamp: string]: number;
    }
    ```

    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "1663306125368": 27,
      "1663306125390": 21
    }
    ```

- Once the data starts coming into Firebase, keep fetching it in your app and plot following live charts:
  1. Realtime data of voltage and temperature in one graph.
  2. Average data per 3 minutes of voltage.
  3. Average data per 3 minutes of Temperature.

## Running Node Red With Docker

```bash
# with volume
docker volume create node-red-data
docker run -it -p 1880:1880 --name mynodered -v node-red-data:/data nodered/node-red

# unpresisted
docker run -it -p 1880:1880 --name mynodered nodered/node-red
```
